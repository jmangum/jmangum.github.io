I am a Scientist at the [National Radio Astronomy Observatory](https://science.nrao.edu) in Charlottesville Virginia.  My main areas of research are in the study of the star formation process in galaxies and radio telescope design and characterization.  I am also Editor-in-Chief of the [Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP)](https://https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/pasp).

I grew up in the small Northern California farming community of [Orland](https://www.cityoforland.com/).  I received my B.A. degree in Astronomy from the University of California at Berkeley, and my M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Astronomy from the University of Virginia. In addition to astronomy, I like to build things with microcontrollers (weather stations, LED lamps, etc.) using the [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org) programming language.
